# PyTorch implementation of ENET-PA for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR).

## https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07919/

ENET-PA here is implemented in PyTorch. Adversarial learning along with perceptual loss (hence P+A). The model is in the form of a GAN and does 4x upscaling of 64x64 images to 512x512.
